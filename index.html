      <h1>What is Treaty One?</h1>
      <p>
        Treaty One was an agreement signed on August 3, 1871, at Lower Fort
        Garry, Manitoba. It was made between the British Crown (European
        settlers) and
        <span style="color: rgb(158, 60, 132)"
          >leaders of seven First Nations</span
        >
        — The Anishinaabe and The Cree people. The treaty was made to show how
        the land would be divided and how the government would support First
        Nations communities. However, there were misunderstandings and
        disagreements about what the treaty actually meant.

    <!-- Section explaining why First Nations signed Treaty One -->
    <div class="treaty-section">
      <h2>Why Did First Nations Sign Treaty One?</h2>
      <p>
        First Nations leaders signed Treaty One because significant changes were
        happening in their communities. More settlers were coming to their land,
        and they wanted to find a way to coexist peacefully. The buffalo, a
        vital food source, was disappearing, and the treaty was seen as a way to
        receive support, including food, education, and farming tools to prevent
        starvation.
      </p>
      <p>
        First Nations people did not view the treaty as surrendering their land.
        Instead, they believed they were agreeing to share the land, not give it
        up entirely.

    <!-- Section explaining the Government's reasons for wanting the treaty -->
    <div class="treaty-section">
      <h2>Why Did the Government Want the Treaty?</h2>
      <p>
        The British government and settlers wanted the treaty because they
        sought more land to build farms, towns, and railways in the Red River
        Valley and around Lake Winnipeg. They also wanted peace, as conflicts
        between settlers and Indigenous peoples in the United States were
        escalating, and the Canadian government wanted to avoid similar issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        The government also sought control over the rich natural resources in
        the area, which they could exploit for profit.

    <!-- Section explaining the aftermath of Treaty One -->
    <div class="treaty-section">
      <h2>What Happened After the Treaty Was Signed?</h2>
      <p>
        After the signing of Treaty One, issues arose. The government took most
        of the land, which the First Nations believed was meant to be shared.
        The government, however, treated it as a full surrender of land.
        Promises made in the treaty were not kept, including providing food,
        money, and farming tools, and land was taken without permission.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, First Nations reserves were smaller than promised, and
        land was given to settlers instead. These broken promises led to
        disputes and protests that continue today.

    <!-- Section explaining why Treaty One is still important today -->
    <div class="treaty-section">
      <h2>Why Is Treaty One Still Important Today?</h2>
      <p>
        Treaty One remains important today because it affects land rights. First
        Nations leaders are still working to ensure the government upholds its
        promises regarding land and support.
      </p>
      <p>
        Canadians today are learning more about treaties to better respect
        Indigenous rights and work toward fairness. Treaty One was intended to
        promote peace and cooperation, but misunderstandings and broken promises
        have caused long-lasting issues. Understanding the treaties helps us
        learn from the past and work toward a more just future.
